# Frontend React.js Developer Assignment - Submission by [Saurabh Singh]

## Project Overview
This project is a simplified web application developed using React.js. It includes three main pages: Home, Transaction, and Data, with seamless navigation implemented using React Router. The Transaction page features form input validation checks, error handling, and the ability to submit data to Google Firestore. The Data page fetches data from an open-source API, filters and visualizes the data in a table format, and includes a pie chart using D3.js/Recharts/Highcharts for data visualization. Error handling provides clear and user-friendly messages, and the code is clean, concise, and well-commented.
